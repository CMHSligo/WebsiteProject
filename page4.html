            <p id="otherText"> The bullet ant is a tropical rainforest ant named for its powerfully painful sting,
			which is said to be comparable to being shot with a bullet. The bullet ant has many common names, however.
			In Venezuela, it is called the "24-hour ant" because the pain of a sting can last a full day.
			In Brazil, the ant is called formigão-preto or "big black ant."
			The Indigenous names for the ant translate to, "the one who wounds deeply." 
			By any name, this ant is feared and respected for its sting. </p>
            <p id="bulletpoints"> <br>
			
			• Biological name: Paraponera clavata<br>
			• The Bullet Ant is found in the hot, humid rainforests of Central and South America.<br>
			• The bullet ant's sting is known for being the most painful sting of any insect. The pain, which has been compared to being shot with a bullet, naturally dissipates after 24 hours..<br>
