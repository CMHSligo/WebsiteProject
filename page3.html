				<p id="otherText"> Fire ants are several species of ants in the genus Solenopsis.
					They are, however, only a minority in the genus, which includes over 200 species of Solenopsis worldwide.
					Solenopsis are stinging ants, and most of their common names reflect this, for example, ginger ants and tropical fire ants.
					Many species also are called red ants because of their light brown color,
					though species of ants in many other genera are so named for similar reasons.
					Examples include Myrmica rubra and Pogonomyrmex barbatus. 
					None of these names apply in all countries nor to all species of Solenopsis, nor only to Solenopsis species;
					for example the colloquial names for several species of weaver ants in the genus Oecophylla in Southeast Asia include
					"fire ants" because of their red color and painful sting; the two genera, however, are not closely related.
					Also, Wasmannia auropunctata is commonly called the "little fire ant".</p>

				• Biological name: Solenopsis geminata.<br>
				• These ants are extremely aggressive and will sting anything they perceive as a threat.<br>
				• Fire ants do not hibernate during extreme winter months, and as a result most (but not all) of them die.<br>
