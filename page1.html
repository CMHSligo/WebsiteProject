				<p id="otherText"> These ants belong to the genus Camponotus and are known for excavating wood. They are characterized by petiole with one node, an evenly rounded upper surface of thorax (workers). They do not consume wood but just chew and convert it into sawdust. This is done by them usually for making pathways, tunnels, or nests.  These ants are omnivorous. These ants are some of the largest ants that exist and range from 3.4 to 13 mm long. They are most commonly found in black color. However, some species may be red or yellow colored.</p>
